# Pac-Man Classifier with Random Forest

## Introduction
This is a Machine Learning project where an agent in the Pac-Man world learns its environment through a data file. This data is fed into a Random Forest classifier implemented from scratch (no scikit-learn). The agent uses data in a text format file, "goodmoves.txt", with the classifier to predict a good movement according to its environment.

## Usage
To execute the agent, use the following command:

```bash
python3 pacman.py ClassifierAgent
```
## Classifiers
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Classification
- Majority voting system
