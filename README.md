# Pac-Man Classifier with Random Forest

## Introduction
This is a Machine Learning project where an agent in the Pac-Man world learns its environment through a data file. This data is fed into a Random Forest classifier implemented from scratch (not using scikit-learn). The agent uses data in a text format file, "goodmoves.txt", with the classifier to predict a good movement according to its environment.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eaguaida/Classifier_RF_Pac-Man-.git
cd Classifier_RF_Pac-Man-
python3 pacman.py ClassifierAgent
```
## Features
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Classification
- Majority voting system

## Dependencies
